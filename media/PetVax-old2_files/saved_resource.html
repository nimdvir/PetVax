        <h2>Our Vaccination Services</h2>
        <p>Vaccinations are a critical component of your pet’s wellness program, essential for preventing life-threatening diseases. At PetVax, we offer a full range of core and non-core vaccines tailored to your pet's specific needs.</p>

        <h2>Why Vaccinate Your Pet?</h2>
        <p>Vaccines play a vital role in safeguarding your pet’s health. By exposing your pet’s immune system to a harmless or inactive form of infectious agents, vaccines help their body develop immunity. This prepares their immune system to effectively combat the real thing if they are ever exposed. The diseases that vaccines prevent range from mildly irritating to potentially fatal, making vaccination a simple, painless, and cost-effective way to protect your pet.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Core and Non-Core Vaccines</h2>
        <p>Vaccines are categorized as either ‘core’ or ‘non-core.’ Core vaccines are essential for all pets, while non-core vaccines are optional and may be recommended based on your pet’s lifestyle and environment.</p>

        <h2>Core Dog Vaccines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Rabies</span>: Legally required in New York; protects against a fatal disease.</li>
            <li><span>DHPPi</span>: A combination vaccine that protects against Distemper, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza, and Infectious Hepatitis.</li>
            <li><span>Leptospirosis</span>: Protects against a dangerous bacterial infection. Although not universally considered a core vaccine, we strongly recommend it for all dogs in New York, where leptospirosis is prevalent. In New York City, leptospirosis is commonly contracted through urine spread by rats, mice, raccoons, and in upstate New York, deer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Non-Core Dog Vaccines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Bordetella</span>: Prevents kennel cough; required by boarding and daycare facilities and recommended for dogs frequently in contact with other dogs. It’s easily transmitted through “nose to nose” contact, so any dog that frequently attends dog parks is highly recommended to get boosted every 6 months.</li>
            <li><span>Lyme</span>: Protects against Lyme disease, carried by ticks, especially in areas with high tick exposure. Highly recommended for dogs that go on hiking trips, visit nature reserves, state parks, or any natural area with tall grass.</li>
            <li><span>Canine Influenza Virus</span>: Protects against dog flu, a contagious virus causing respiratory issues. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) recommends canine influenza vaccines for dogs exposed to other dogs through activities or places where dogs congregate, such as boarding facilities, dog parks, or doggy daycares. It may also be advisable for dogs that travel or have heart or respiratory conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Core Cat Vaccines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Rabies</span>: Legally required in New York, even for indoor cats.</li>
            <li><span>FVRCP</span>: A combination vaccine that protects against Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, Calicivirus, and Panleukopenia.</li>
            <li><span>Feline Leukemia Virus</span>: An incurable virus transmitted through cat bites. Recommended for kittens, regardless of their future outdoor exposure; booster shots are not needed for older indoor-only cats.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Vaccination Schedules</h2>
        <p>We provide personalized vaccination schedules tailored to your pet’s needs and send reminders one month before any booster is due. Here’s a sample vaccination schedule:</p>
